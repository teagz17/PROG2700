### Assignment: Weather Forecast Application

#### Objective:
Develop a client-side web application that uses the OpenWeather API to display the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a specified city. The application should be styled according to guidelines and use pure JavaScript for functionality. Additionally, design the user interface using Figma or a similar tool.

#### Requirements:

1. **API Integration:**
   - Use the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data.
   - Retrieve current weather and 5-day forecast data by city name.
   - Handle JSON data format for all API responses.

2. **Current Weather Display:**
   - Show the current temperature, low and high temperatures, wind speed, and humidity.
   - Include an icon representing the current weather condition.
   - Display a summary with the current date and time.
   - Provide an option to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature display.

3. **5-Day Forecast Display:**
   - Show the day of the week and date for each forecasted day.
   - Include an icon representing the forecasted weather condition.
   - Display the low and high temperatures for each day.

4. **User Interface Design:**
   - Use Figma or a similar tool to design the user interface.
   - Create wireframes and mockups for the application layout.
   - Ensure the design is responsive and user-friendly.
   - Include design elements such as icons, buttons, and input fields.
   - Share the Figma design file or export the design as images to include in the project submission.

5. **User Interface Implementation:**
   - Please review the sample app attached.
   - Style the application according to CSS guidelines based on the Figma design.
   - Ensure the application is responsive and user-friendly.
   - Use pure JavaScript for all functionality (no libraries or frameworks).

6. **Additional Features:**
   - Implement error handling for invalid city names or API request failures.
   - Provide a loading indicator while fetching data from the API.
   - Allow users to search for weather data by entering a city name.

7. **Submission:**
   - Submit a zipped project directory containing all files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any assets).
   - Include the Figma design file or exported images of the design.
   - Ensure the project is well-organized and includes comments in the code for clarity.
   - Submit the zipped project directory via Brightspace.

#### Deliverables:
- A fully functional weather forecast application.
- A zipped project directory containing all source files.
- A Figma design file or exported images of the design.
- A brief README file explaining the project structure and any setup instructions.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness: The application meets all specified requirements.
- Code Quality: The code is well-organized, commented, and follows best practices.
- User Interface: The application is visually appealing and easy to use.
- Functionality: The application handles errors gracefully and provides a smooth user experience.
- Design: The Figma design is well-thought-out and effectively guides the implementation.
